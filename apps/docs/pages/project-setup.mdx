- Before you get started with the project, you must be familiar with the [prerequisites]().To get started we are going to go through project setup and installation.

### Project Setup

Before you setup grimoire locally on your computer. Make sure you have the follwing installed.

- [**Node js 18 >**](https://nodejs.org) - javascript runtime
- [**Vscode**](https://nodejs.org) - preferred IDE
- [**yarn**](https://nodejs.org) - preferred package manager

- Clone the repository. (_make sure you have been granted access to the repo before cloning it_)

```bash filename="Terminal" {1} copy
git clone https://github.com/kolynzb/Grimoire.git
# Move into project directory(root)
cd Grimoire
```

### Install Packages

- Install all dependencies for the project to work

```bash filename="Terminal"  copy
yarn install
```

- Install the different dependencies in the independent apps (_find these in the apps folder_) or the app you prefer to contribute to.To find the apps that intrest you check the contribute section of the docs.

## VSCode Extension Recommendations

This repository makes use of Visual Studio Code's [recommended extensions feature](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=827846). This means: If you use VS Code and open the repository for the first time, VS Code will tell you that the repository recommends to install a handful of extensions. These extensions are recommended if you work with Grimoire and will make contributing much easier. The recommendations are specified in the file `.vscode/extensions.json`.

Since installing extensions is sometimes a matter of taste, we have added short descriptions for each recommended extension within that file to explain why we recommend it. This way you can make your own decision whether or not you want to install any of these extensions (for example, the SVG extension is not necessary if you do not work with the SVG files provided in the repository).

If you choose not to install all of the recommended extensions at once (which we recommend), VS Code will show you the recommendations in the extensions sidebar so you can first decide which of the ones you'd like to install and then manually install those you'd like to have.

> Using the same extensions as the core developer team will make the code generally more consistent since you will have the same visual feedback.

### To Run Project

- Start the monorepo. (_this is powered by [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs)_)

```bash filename="Terminal"  copy
yarn dev
```
