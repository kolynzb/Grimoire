## **Project Overview**:

Grimoire is a software application aimed at simplifying the process of creating, managing, and visualizing database schemas.

## **Objectives**:

- Develop a web-based application with an interactive and responsive user interface.
- Provide a feature-rich platform for creating, editing, and visualizing database schemas using an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) approach.
- Offer real-time collaboration capabilities, allowing multiple users to work on the same schema simultaneously.
- Incorporate advanced editing tools, validation mechanisms, and error handling to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- Enable seamless integration with popular database management systems (DBMS) for importing and exporting schema definitions.
- Implement an AI-powered feature for generating entity diagrams from natural language descriptions.
- Allow users to add notes, comments, and documentation to entities and diagrams for enhanced collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## **Features**:

- Interactive Diagram Creation: Drag-and-drop interface for creating entities, attributes, and relationships on a canvas.
- Data Modeling Tools: Tools for defining attributes, data types, keys, constraints, and cardinality.
- Real-time Collaboration: Simultaneous editing, conflict resolution, and user permissions for collaborative work.
- Advanced Editing Capabilities: Resize, reposition, and style entities, attributes, and relationships.
- Data Validation and Error Handling: Real-time error detection, validation rules, and error highlighting.
- Export and Integration: Export diagrams in various formats (PDF, images, SQL scripts) and integration with DBMS.
- AI Entity Diagram Generation: AI-powered feature for generating entity diagrams from natural language inputs.
- Notes and Comments: Ability to add notes, comments, and documentation to entities and diagrams.
- Embedded Iframes and URLs: Generate embeddable iframes and unique URLs for sharing and viewing diagrams externally.
- \_In addition to the existing features, Grimoire aims to expand its capabilities to include system design diagram implementations. This future enhancement will empower users to design and visualize complex system architectures, such as network diagrams, component diagrams, and deployment diagrams. By integrating system design functionality into Grimoire, users will have a comprehensive toolset to design and communicate both database schemas and broader system architectures within a single platform.\_\_

## **Project Deliverables**:

- Fully functional web-based application with an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- Diagram creation and editing capabilities, including entity and relationship management.
- Real-time collaboration features for team-based work on database schemas.
- AI Entity Diagram Generation feature for automated schema creation from natural language inputs.
- Validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity.
- Export options for diagrams in various formats.
- Notes and comments functionality for enhanced collaboration and documentation.

## **Constraints and Assumptions**:

- The project will be developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
- The target browsers for the application will include the latest versions of popular web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- The project assumes access to a suitable development environment and necessary development tools.
- The project will prioritize security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

## **Timeline and Milestones**:

## **Budget and Resources**:

- The project budget will be determined based on the estimated development efforts, including personnel, infrastructure, and any external dependencies.
